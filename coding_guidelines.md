Coding guidelines
=================

Rule 
------

Write a program/library that do one thing and do it well. [2]

**Rationale**: [Unix got it right](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html).
While it might not be in the nature of a program to do one thing, any program
can be designed as a combination of modules which do one thing. This improves
testability and your ability to reason about the program and its components.


Rule 
------

[Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/04/02/simple/).
Use simple data structures and simple algorithms [3].
Worse is Better [5].

> When in doubt use brute force [4]


Rule 
------

Short and sweet. Maximum line width of 80 characters. Short, descriptive variable names [3].
Functions should fit on a single piece of paper [1].
